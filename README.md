## Description
3rd year student at the University of Auckland. Loves building solution that serves its purpose seamlessly, or automating a chain of processes until it can't be more automated. Might have to try countless different implementations, or read through old documentations that no soul has visited since 2010, but at the end of the day, it's all worth it when something finally works as intended. I aspired to contribute to impactful softwares projects.

## Academic Experiences
With 4 years of programming experience with C, Java, Python, C, Matlab, R. Since November 2022, I have completed my study in Part II Software Engineering, covering some core concepts:
- Data Structures & Algorithms
- Object oriented programming (Java)
- Statistical analysis (R)
- Computer engineering fundamentals
- Software quality control (JUnit)

In 2023 I will be studying:
- Database Systems (SQL)
- Operating Systems (C)
- Computer graphics & Image processing (OpenGL)
- Project across multiple engineering disciplines 

- Software Architecture (REST API, JAX-RS)
- Software Engineering Design 2 (Android app development)
- Networks & Security
- Software Maintenance & Evolution (Project life cycle & documentation) (Discord bot development, Node / React / Typescript) 

## Projects
Some personal and academic projects in the past:
- A* algorithm which generates most optimal schedule to execute a CPU task graph, with dynamic interactive visualisation written in JavaFx.
- Native android app developed under a team of 3, focused on providing a premium platform for browsing and purchasing football team shirts.
- JavaFX game developed under a team of 3, main element beingplayer has to draw based on a random prompt, given a limited amount time, if the quick-draw machine learning prediction model has the matching prediction, the player wins. 
- Python barcode detection algorithm, capable of detecting location of barcode in an image or video, by ustiliting mathematical image processing techiniques.
- Discord bot developed by a team of 6, capable of scheduling and managing movie nights in a discord server.
- Arch linux system completely customized for personal use, likes to mess with linux systems.
- CLI game simulating blackjack involving the player, 2 other player bots, and a dealer bot. Utilizes OOP design patterns to implement changing bot behaviours.
- (WIP) JavaFX app, it is fundamentally a timer that help to time and monitor the user's workflow when using the pomodoro technique. Personally want to enrich the pomodoro process with more app features to make studying more fun & attractive.


^Extremely eager to put these knowledge and experiences to use.^

## Teamwork
I usually play a supportive role in the team. That is, when there is a position unfilled, or a task unattended, I'm willing to be the one that gets it done, if it is within my ability.

Recently uncovering leadership traits in myself across certain projects, more than willing to organize meetings, delegate tasks to get things done in time.
