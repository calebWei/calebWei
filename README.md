## Description
Currently a 3rd year student @ the University of Auckland. Always enjoyed the problem solving process, whether it's building solutions that serves its purpose seamlessly, or automating a chain of processes until it can't be more automated. I might have to try countless different implementations, or read through old documentations that no soul has visited since 2010, but at the end of the day, it's all worth it when something finally works as intended.

I believe that engineers are hugely responsible for the development of our society. It's an important role that needs to be treated with utmost responsibility and effort. Aspired to contribute to impactful softwares projects.

## Academic Experiences
With 4 years of programming experience with C, Java, Python, C, Matlab, R. As of November 2022, I have completed my study in Part II Software Engineering, covering some core concepts:
- Data Structures & Algorithms
- Object oriented programming (Java)
- Statistical analysis (R)
- Computer engineering fundamentals
- Software quality control (JUnit)

In 2023 I will be studying:
- Database Systems (SQL)
- Operating Systems (C)
- Computer graphics & Image processing (OpenGL)
- Project Management

- Software Architecture (RESTful framework, JAX-RS)
- Software Engineering Design 2 (Android app development)
- Networks & Security
- Software Maintenance & Evolution (Project life cycle & documentation)

## Projects
Some personal and academic projects in the past:
- Native android app developed under a team of 3, focused on providing a premium platform for browsing and purchasing football team shirts.
- JavaFX game developed under a team of 3, main element beingplayer has to draw based on a random prompt, given a limited amount time, if the quick-draw machine learning prediction model has the matching prediction, the player wins. 
- Python barcode detection algorithm, capable of detecting location of barcode in an image or video, by ustiliting mathematical image processing techiniques.
- Discord bot developed by a team of 6, capable of scheduling and managing movie nights in a discord server.
- Arch linux system completely customized for personal use, likes to mess with linux systems.
- CLI game simulating blackjack involving the player, 2 other player bots, and a dealer bot. Utilizes OOP design patterns to implement changing bot behaviours.
- (WIP) JavaFX app, it is fundamentally a timer that help to time and monitor the user's workflow when using the pomodoro technique. Personally want to enrich the pomodoro process with more app features to make studying more fun & attractive.


^Extremely eager to put these knowledge and experiences to use.^

## Traits
I usually play a supportive role in the team. That is, when there is a position unfilled, or a task unattended, I'm willing to be the one that gets it done, if it is within my ability.

Hates when something goes unsmooth, which turns out to be a rather useful trait. Whenever something important comes up, I tend to plan ahead and double check everything that could present as a liability. It's not a fun trait to have, but it did help me prepare for things that I find myself less confident with.
