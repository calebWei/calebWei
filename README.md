# Profile

## Description

Final year student at the University of Auckland. Loves building solutions that serve their purpose seamlessly, or automating a chain of processes until it can't be more automated. Might have to try countless different implementations, or read through old documentations that no soul has visited since 2010, but at the end of the day, it's all worth it when something finally works as intended. Aspires to contribute to impactful software projects.

## Projects

Some personal and academic projects from the past:

1. A* algorithm which generates most optimal schedule to execute a CPU task graph, with dynamic interactive visualisation written in JavaFx.
2. Native android app developed under a team of 3, focused on providing a premium platform for browsing and purchasing football team shirts.
3. JavaFX game developed under a team of 3, main element being player has to draw based on a random prompt, given a limited amount time, if the quick-draw machine learning prediction model has the matching prediction, the player wins. 
4. Python barcode detection algorithm, capable of detecting location of barcode in an image or video, by utilizing mathematical image processing techniques.
5. Discord bot developed by a team of 6, capable of scheduling and managing movie nights in a discord server.
6. Arch Linux system completely customized for personal use, likes to mess with Linux systems.
7. CLI game simulating blackjack involving the player, 2 other player bots, and a dealer bot. Utilizes OOP design patterns to implement changing bot behaviours.
8. (WIP) JavaFX app, it is fundamentally a timer that helps to time and monitor the user's workflow when using the pomodoro technique. Personally want to enrich the pomodoro process with more app features to make studying more fun & attractive.

## Teamwork

Usually plays a supportive role in the team. That is, when there is a position unfilled, or a task unattended, willing to be the one that gets it done, if it is within ability. Recently uncovering leadership traits across certain projects, more than willing to organize meetings, delegate tasks to get things done in time.
