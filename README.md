# Profile

To put it plainly, I have always enjoyed problem solving, and building a solution or system that works its job flawlessly. I'm also a big fan of automating all sorts of tasks, either simple or complex.

But in the greater scope of things, I believe that engineers are responsible for driving the growth of our society, therefore, it is an important job that needs to be attended with utmost effort and sense of responsibility. Although I'm excited yet equally intimidated by this view, I still want to be a part of it.

I have done coding in Visual Basic, Python and C across the past 4 years.
In 2022 I'm currently studying:
- Data Structures & Algorithms
- Object Oriented Programming in Java
- Statistical analysis in R
- Computer engineering fundamentals

But later on in 2022 I will also be studying:
- Software design & Quality assurance
- Software engineering Professional skills & Communications

I'm always nervous of something going unsmooth, which turns out to be very useful. Whenever something important comes up, I like to plan ahead, and triple-check everything that could be a liability. This habit is not always pleasant for myself, but it forces me to over-prepare for things that I value.

When I lack the skill or experience to lead others, I'm usually the supportive player in a team. That is, when there is a position unfilled, or a task unattended, I'm willing to be the one that gets it done, if it is within my ability to do so. If I am confident with my experience and skill-set, I can take the role of a mentor or trainer that assists others in the team.
