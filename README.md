# Profile

## Description

I'm a final-year software engineering student from the University of Auckland, and I'm passionate in AI, automation, and web development. I love the idea of building small projects with the potential to deliver great significance to a large group of people. I'm have been rotating between a variety of teams and projects for the past 4 years, so I'm no stranger to working effectively in diverse and fast-paced environments.

## Projects

Some personal and academic projects from the past:

1. [Online web game](https://purrlock-holme-s-cryptography-agency.onrender.com/) about solving cryptography puzzles as a cat detective. 
2. Full-stack development and deployment of software web-solution for nurses, parents, and administrators to record and monitor baby conditions.
3. A* algorithm which generates most optimal schedule to execute a CPU task graph, with dynamic interactive visualisation written in JavaFx.
4. Native android app developed under a team of 3, focused on providing a premium platform for browsing and purchasing football team shirts.
5. JavaFX game developed under a team of 3, main element being player has to draw based on a random prompt, given a limited amount time, if the quick-draw machine learning prediction model has the matching prediction, the player wins. 
6. Python barcode detection algorithm, capable of detecting location of barcode in an image or video, by utilizing mathematical image processing techniques.
7. Discord bot developed by a team of 6, capable of scheduling and managing movie nights in a discord server.
8. Arch Linux system completely customized for personal use, likes to mess with Linux systems.
9. CLI game simulating blackjack involving the player, 2 other player bots, and a dealer bot. Utilizes OOP design patterns to implement changing bot behaviours.
10. (WIP) JavaFX app, it is fundamentally a timer that helps to time and monitor the user's workflow when using the pomodoro technique. Personally want to enrich the pomodoro process with more app features to make studying more fun & attractive.
